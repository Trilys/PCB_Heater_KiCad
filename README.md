# PCB\_Heater\_KiCad
Python script to generate a PCB resistor heater for KiCad using tracks.

## What does it do :  
Create a sample 'test.kicad\_pcb' file in Project. If you have KiCad installed, you can see the result at the end of the execution.

## How does it work :
    pcb_heater_kicad.py -x 10 -y 20
Will generate a file test.kicad_pcb which contains the track heater for a PCB of 10mm√ó20mm.
