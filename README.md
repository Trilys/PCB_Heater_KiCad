# PCB\_Heater\_KiCad
Python script to generate a PCB resistor heater for KiCad using tracks.

## What does it do :  
Create a sample of '.kicad\_pcb' file which needs to be included in your own '.kicad\_pcb'.

## How does it work :
    pcb_heater_kicad.py -x 10 -y 20
Will generate a file test.kicad_pcb which contains the track heater for a PCB of 10mm√ó20mm.
